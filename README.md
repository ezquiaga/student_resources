# Student Resources

This repository aims at collecting tools and resources that might be useful for students starting doing research. 
There is a wide range of resources, from practical notebooks to best practices for plotting.

Given my own research, there is an emphasis on gravitational waves. For example, you can find notebooks explaining how to generate a gravitational wave signal.

This repository is very much under construction, please send feedback to jose.ezquiaga@nbi.ku.dk

The basic gravitational wave code is [LALsuite](https://docs.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/lalsimulation/index.html).

LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity curves can be found here: https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T2000012-v1/public (tables with the frequency and amplitude spectral density (ASD) are provided - note that the power spectral density (PSD) is the square of the ASD!). Next generation sensitivity curves are here: https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1500293-v11/public

- As an introduction to the subject of gravitational waves, I like Michele Maggiore's [Gravitational Waves Vol. 1 book](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/gravitational-waves-9780198570745?cc=dk&lang=en&). In particular chapter 4.1 for understanding the sigals from compact binary coalescences and chapter 7 for learning about the basic data analysis techniques
