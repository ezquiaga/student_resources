# Student Resources

This repository collects information and notebooks that might be useful for students starting doing research such as best practices for plotting.

There are also notebooks on basic generation of gravitational wave signal.

The basic gravitational wave code is [LALsuite](https://docs.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/lalsimulation/index.html).

LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity curves can be found here: https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T2000012-v1/public (tables with the frequency and amplitude spectral density (ASD) are provided - note that the power spectral density (PSD) is the square of the ASD!)


This repository is very much under construction, please send feedback to jose.ezquiaga@nbi.ku.dk
