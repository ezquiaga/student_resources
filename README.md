# Student Resources

This repository collects information and notebooks that might be useful for students starting doing research such as best practices for plotting.

There are also notebooks on basic generation of gravitational wave signal.

The basic gravitational wave code is LALsuite.

This repository is very much under construction, please send feedback to jose.ezquiaga@nbi.ku.dk
