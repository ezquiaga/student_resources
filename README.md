# Student Resources

This repository aims at collecting tools and resources that might be useful for students starting doing research. 
There is a wide range of resources, from practical notebooks to best practices for plotting.

Given my own research, there is an emphasis on gravitational waves. For example, you can find notebooks explaining how to generate a gravitational wave signal.
